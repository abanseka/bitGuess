A browser based guessing game created in vanilla javascript

## To run the game:

### How the game works
1. when you just launch the game you are welcomed by a retro looking game interface
2. all you have to do is try to guess the number behind the ? mark
3. you type your guess into the box and press enter.
4. if your guess is too high, you will have a message "too high"
5. and if it is too low, you'll have a message saying "too low"
6. if you make the correct guess, the background changes from black to green
7. with each attempt a score is recorded
8. the game ends when you exhaust all rounds.
